# Waving Localizations

Waving is an upcoming revolutionary dating application made by Ziph0n. I would like to translate Waving in as many languages as possible.

**All translators, even if you don't translate everything in your language, will receive a lifetime free premium subscription.** Just add your Twitter handle at the top of the Localizable.strings file and I'll contact you.

## How to translate Waving

If you're comfortable with git, fork this repository, edit the file to be translated and do a pull request

If you're not comfortable with git, open the file to be translated on your browser, click on the pen (edit button), edit the file and click on "Pull Request"

## Instructions

There are 3 folders with different files to translate, please translate them all if you can. There's also a sketch file containing the screenshots of Waving for the App Store. Please only touch to the text to translate it. Don't touch to the images

`"%d miles away" = "%d miles away";`

* Do not modify anything before the equal (=) sign. Only translate what's after the equal sign.
* Keep all quotation mark (")
* Keep %d and %@, do not remove them. They indicate a decimal number (%d) or a text (%@)

If your language isn't listed, please message me on Twitter or create an issue and I'll add your language.
