Meet people. With your voice.

WAVING: WHAT IS IT?

Waving is a unique revolutionary dating application solely based on the voice. The voice can reveal the beauty, kindness and true personality of a person.
You will not be influenced by a misleading image or context. Words are all important and appeal to your imagination.
Reveal yourself.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

Nothing's easier:
- You create your account either with your Facebook account or with your email address and password
- You record your voice, you talk about what you want (the number of recording is unlimited)
- The profiles that match you and close to you are displayed
- You swipe right if you like the profile
- You swipe left if you do not like the profile
- If there is a match, then you can chat privately
- You can also send a chat request to differentiate yourself from other profiles

Downloading and using Waving are free! Enjoy!
